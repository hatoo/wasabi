# noli - glue between WasabiOS and its applications

This code will be shared between WasabiOS and its applications.
Eventually, this crate should be free from all external crates for educational purposes.
Of course, each application can import external crates as they want.

To see the API references, run:

```
cargo doc --open
```

To run unit tests, run:

```
cargo test --package noli
```
